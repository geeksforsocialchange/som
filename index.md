      <p>This collection of stories is about love.</p>

      <p>It is also about hidden lives, sometimes painful, sometimes heart-breaking, always important. The oral histories of relationships across the divides of race and celebrates the ways in which women sustain and support their families over time.</p>

      <p>Like all hidden histories, these stories represent living knowledge that can inform future generations and can help us think differently about the experiences of children from interracial relationships.</p>

    <h1 class="h2">Background on the project</h1>

    <p class="narrow">SOM does not fictionalise life but tells it just as we live it. Sometimes it is cruel and heart-breaking but even then, families pull on through. In many cases hardship and heartache makes the bond of family stronger, especially when Mothers stepped away from the relationship into single parenthood. Fathers too became the sole carer of their children when mothers left because they couldn’t or didn’t want to stay in the home.</p>

    <p class="narrow">Strength of Our Mothers a 2017-2019 partnership project led by National Black Arts Alliance, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>

    <p class="narrow">NBAA is the UK’s largest network of Black artists established in 1985 it exists to combat negative attitudes to Black arts and culture. Its heritage work in social history contributes to debates around migration, interracial marriage, and class to challenge racist narratives.</p>
